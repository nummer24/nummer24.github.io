Here we spent a large part of our time behind the counter, where we bake from monday until saturday. Sunday we’re closed - that is “when we collect energy”. Our selection ranges from fiber rich bread to cinnabuns and cake. </p></section> </div></article> <section> <div class="aabningstider"> <h1 class="aabningstider" id="aaben">Opening Hours</h1> <p class="aabningstiderlille"><span class="dage"> Mon-Sat:</span> 8-17 <span class="dage"><br>Sunday:</span> Closed</p></div></section> <article> <h1 class="kc">From heavy books to dough balls</h1> <section><img src="images/karenogchristian.jpg" class="kcimg" alt="Karen og Chrstian"> <p class="kcp">We both have a long-term education, but quickly realised, that it was more important to spent time with our 3 children, than our work. We then bought an abandoned farm in Vestjylland. After an inspirational trip to Japan, we found a passion in mushroom cultivation and decided to start a mushroom farm. After 15 years of organic mushroom production that had never before been produced in Europe, we decided it was time for something new. We sold the farm and moved to Aarhus, where we found a townhouse in the heart of the city - the Latin Quarter. In 2012 we opened Nummer 24 and have since not looked back. None of us have an education in the field, but it is instead, the desire, passion and skills that drive our bakery. </p></section> </article> <article> <div> <h1 class="bk">Our <br>core values</h1> <section> <div class="blaakasse"> <p class="blaakassetekst">Our open kitchen enriches the bakery with a wonderful scent and lets the customer keep track of what’s happening behind the backdrop. It is very important for us, to create an experience for the customer. When people enter through the door, we should not only sell them a product, but also invite them inside to feel the cozy atmosphere and have excess of time to talk with them. </p></div><picture> <source media="(min-width:768px)" srcset="images/skaeretbroed.jpg" class="billedeblaa"> <source media="(min-width:1025px)" srcset="images/skaeretbroed.jpg" class="billedeblaa"> <img src="images/brod-laekkert.jpg" class="billedeblaa" alt="Friskbagt brød"> </picture> <div class="blaakasseto tabletclass"> <p class="blaakassetekst">All bread and cakes are made solely with biodynamic flour and organic ingredients, there is used many old and local grains, such as ølandshvede, spelt and emmer. All of our sour dough has raised for at least 24 hours. Our prices are very low, so everybody can enjoy our bread and cakes. People often ask us, why we don’t raise the prices, but it’s not important for us to earn a lot of money, We think that the price should be fair compared to what you buy. </p></div></section> </div><img src="images/friskbagtbroed.jpg" class="laptopbil" alt="Hvedebrød"> </article> <section> <h1 id="hej">Stop by and say hi!</h1> <div class="facadeimgto"> <img src="images/facadebillede.jpg" class="facadeimg" alt="Nummer 24 facade"> <aside> <h2 class="facadetekst">Did you know?<br><span class="ikfed">All of our sour dough has raised for at least 24 hours.</span></h2> </aside> </div><iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m18!1m12!1m3!1d2931.878451590431!2d10.207872166947324!3d56.15864739640117!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x464c3f96f2802853%3A0x6b4ceef131775e16!2sNummer+24!5e0!3m2!1sda!2sdk!4v1511174491031" class="googlekort" id="navklik"></iframe> </section> <footer> <p> Adress:<br>Graven 24<br>8000 Aarhus C </p><p>Call us!<br>20 98 07 05</p></footer> <div class="barbund"> </div></div></body></html>
